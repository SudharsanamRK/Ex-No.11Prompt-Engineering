2. Dress the subject in human-like accessories (sunglasses) to add humor and relatability.
3. Create a prop (sunscreen bottle) clearly labeled with a catchy phrase and SPF level.
4. Include a bold headline using a pun related to sunburn (e.g., “Don’t Get Fried”).
5. Add a short, positive tagline encouraging sunscreen use (“Don’t fry, just shine.”).
6. Use high contrast colors (black background, yellow bottle) to enhance readability and visual appeal.
7. Ensure the composition keeps the focus on both the chicken and the product being promoted.
